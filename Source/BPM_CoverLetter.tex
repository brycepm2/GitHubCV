Dear Ansys Hiring Team,

I was excited to see the opening for a R\&D Engineer II at
Ansys while browsing the company website.
%
I have been fully focused on the research and development of
computational methods for engineering software as I worked towards
completing my PhD at the University of Illinois.
%
I have a passion for work at the interface
of computing and engineering and the power it has to change the world.
%
Working for a company with an excellent reputation in this field would
be a great start to my career.
%

I have greatly enjoyed my time learning and creating at the University
of Illinois.
%
The work has been an engaging mix of reading papers, thinking through
problems, writing out the math, planning out algorithms, and
implementing them.
%
All of the implementation is done on a single C++ research code that
is used by many collaborators, where the ability to communicate
is a necessity. 
%
While I have spent plenty of time focusing on the math and physics
that apply to the problems I study, I have also put significant effort
into writing clean, safe and efficient software.
%
I have been operating in a research-heavy role remotely for
several years now, which is another exciting aspect of this position.
%
A main aspect that excites me about this job at Ansys is the ability to
apply these skills to a production-level codebase with.
%
Especially one with a user base as established as that of Ansys' tools.
%

My background is focused on finite element methods and numerical analysis.
%
I have done extensive research in the computational solid mechanics
methods including fracture mechanics, multiscale methods, multiphysics
analysis, and contact mechanics.
%
I have developed a broad skillset and honed my ability to learn new
topics, particularly in math, physics, and software development.
%
While the finished product of my work is compiled into several journal
papers and conference presentations, my favorite part is pen-on-paper math
and commits sent to our git repository.
%

Ansys has been a leader in engineering software for decades now.
%
The company has reach across so many industries from electronics to
aircraft.
%
I have interfaced with a number of employees at various computational
mechanics conferences.
%
It is always interesting to see the advanced applications of the
software. 
%
I have found the fracture mechanics capabilities of the code, as that
is an area I focused on while at the University of Illinois.
%

My passion and skill set align with the mission of Ansys to develop
advanced engineering software tools.
%
My experience and proven ability to perform computational research
and develop engineering software make this a position I would excel in.
%
I would appreciate the opportunity to explore this opening further with you.
%


Sincerely,

Bryce Mazurowski
