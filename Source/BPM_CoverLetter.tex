Dear Ansys Hiring Team,

I was excited to see the opening for a R\&D Engineer II
with a focus on CFD at Ansys while browsing the company website.
%
I have been fully focused on the research and development of
computational methods for engineering software as I worked towards
completing my PhD at the University of Illinois.
%
I have a passion for work at the interface
of computing and engineering and the power it has to change the world.
%
Working for a company with an excellent reputation in this field, like
Ansys, would be a great start to my professional career.
%

I have greatly enjoyed my time learning and creating at the University
of Illinois.
%
The work has been an engaging mix of reading papers, thinking through
problems, writing out the math, planning out algorithms, and
implementing them.
%
My research group implements in a single C++ research code that
is used by many collaborators, where the ability to communicate
is a necessity. 
%
While I have spent plenty of time focusing on the math and physics
that apply to the problems I study, I have also put significant effort
into writing clean, safe, and efficient software.
%
I have been operating in a research-heavy role remotely for
several years now, which is another exciting aspect of this position.
%
Applying my skills to a production-level code, especially one with a
user base as established as that of Ansys' tools, is a very exciting
opportunity.
%

My background is focused on finite element methods and numerical analysis.
%
I have done extensive research in computational solid mechanics
and at the interface of solid mechanics and fluid mechanics.
%
My research work at the University of Illinois was motivated by
high-speed aircraft, where the coupled structure and fluid behavior
must be captured to represent behavior accurately.
%
This has given me a strong background in computational fluid dynamics.
%
I have also developed a broad skill set and honed my ability to learn new
topics, particularly in, physics, and software development.
%
While the finished product of my work is compiled into several journal
papers and conference presentations, my favorite part is pen-on-paper math
and commits sent to our git repository.
%

Ansys has been a leader in engineering software for decades now.
%
The company has reach across so many industries from electronics to
aircraft.
%
I have interfaced with a number of employees at various computational
mechanics conferences.
%
It is always interesting to see the advanced applications of the
software and the excitement all of the employees put into
their work.
%
I would be very excited to become a team member.
%

My passion and skill set align with the mission of Ansys to develop
innovative engineering software tools that ensure customer success.
%
My experience and proven ability to perform computational research
and develop engineering software make this a position I would excel in.
%
I would appreciate the opportunity to explore this opening further with you.
%


Sincerely,

Bryce Mazurowski
