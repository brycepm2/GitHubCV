Dear Exponent Hiring Team,

I was excited to see the opening for a Mechanical Engineer  with an
applied mechanics focus at Exponent. 
%
I have been fully focused on my research in 
computational solid mechanics as I worked towards
completing my PhD at the University of Illinois.
%
I would love to apply my skills to the real-world,
challenging problems that Exponent takes on.
%

I have greatly enjoyed my time learning and creating at the University
of Illinois.
%
The work has been an engaging mix of reading papers, thinking through
problems, writing out the math, planning out algorithms, and
implementing them.
%
This has helped me develop a strong background in mechanics and the
numerical methods used to solve the corresponding partial differential
equations.
%

While I come from a Structural Engineering background and have a sound
understanding in the use of codes for engineering design, my MS and
PhD research has been motivated by high-speed aircraft.
%
This application introduces unique multiphysics and constitutive modeling
decisions into the problem solving process.
%
I have been fortunate enough to dive deep into fracture mechanics,
composite materials, damage mechanics, and multiphysics analysis.
%

In academia, however, we analyze idealized problems.
%
Getting out into the field to inspect engineered parts, and then
developing and executing an analysis plan that fits the in-situ conditions
is an inspiring prospect.
%
The opportunity to do this at Exponent presents an exciting
challenge to apply my skills to.

% Some specifics about Exponent
% Maybe look up a few interesting problems they have solved
% 9/11, JFK assassination, crane failure, train failure
My applied mechanics skills fit well into Exponent's core work.
%
Exponent has utilized the specialized skills of their engineers to analyze 
many exceptional phenomena.
%
From analysis of the tragedies World Trade Center towers failing or the JFK
assassination, it is clear that Exponent secures forensic projects of the
utmost importance.
%
The consistent trust clients put into Exponent to analyze
such a wide variety of interesting and challenging problems is
impressive.
%
Crane failures, aircraft crashes, and structure failures are
disasters, and it is vital that we engineers determine the root cause
of these so we can learn from them and develop better future designs.
%

My passion and skill set align with Exponent's mission to solve 
the toughest engineering problems.
%
My experience and proven ability to solve challenging applied
mechanics problems make this a position I would excel in.
%
I would appreciate the opportunity to explore this opening further with you.
%


Sincerely,

Bryce Mazurowski
