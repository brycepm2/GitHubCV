Dear Zoo Hiring Team,

I was excited to see the opening for a Research Engineer
with a focus on computational geometry while reading through
Zoo's company website.
%
I have been fully focused on the research and development of
computational methods for engineering software as I worked towards
completing my PhD at the University of Illinois.
%
I have a passion for work at the interface
of computing and engineering and the power it has to change the world.
%
Working for an innovator like Zoo would be an ideal start to my career.
%

I have greatly enjoyed my time learning and creating at the University
of Illinois.
%
The work has been an engaging mix of reading papers, thinking through
problems, writing out the math, planning out algorithms, and
implementing them.
%
All of the implementation is done on a single C++ research code that
is used by many collaborators, where the ability to communicate
is a necessity. 
%
I have been operating in a research-heavy role remotely for
several years now, which is another exciting aspect of this position.
%
A main aspect that excites me about this job at Zoo is the ability to
apply these skills to a production-level codebase.
%

My background is focused on finite element methods and numerical analysis.
%
A geometric engine that is based on the software library CGAL is used
in our research code to model interactions between solids and
surfaces, like fracture growth in a body or modeling of fasteners.
%
This has been a big application area of my research and seems to be a
main focus of this position.
%
While the finished product of my work is compiled into several journal
papers and conference presentations, my favorite part is pen-on-paper math
and commits sent to our git repository.
%

CAD software is so fundamental to engineering and
Zoo is developing a tool that I align with.
%
I love the ability to edit CAD via code this results in
a much cleaner and easier-to-follow workflow than button clicks on a GUI.
%
The diff viewer is also a wonderful idea --- incorporating version control
on code and actual visualization of changes into the workflow.
%
When I worked at Boeing, I performed stress analysis work,
recommending geometrical changes to a design engineer.
%
This can be ambiguous and slow, but the diff viewer would fix that.
%

My passion and skill set align with Zoo's mission to develop
advanced tools for hardware design.
%
My experience and proven ability to perform computational research
make this a position I would excel in.
%
I would appreciate the opportunity to explore this opening further with you.
%


Sincerely,

Bryce Mazurowski
