Dear Altair Hiring Team,

I was excited to see the opening for a Lead Software Developer 
focusing on fluid structure interaction at
Altair while browsing the company website.
%
I have been fully focused on the research and development of
computational mechanics software as I worked towards
completing my PhD at the University of Illinois.
%
I am passionate about working at the interface
of computing and engineering and the power it has to change the world.
%
Working for a company like Altair, which has an excellent reputation
in this field, would be a great next step for my career.
%

I have greatly enjoyed learning and creating at the University
of Illinois.
%
The work has been an engaging mix of reading papers, thinking through
problems, writing out the math, planning out algorithms, and
implementing them.
%
My implementation work has been done in a C++ code
used by many collaborators, where the ability to communicate
clearly is a necessity. 
%
While I have spent plenty of time focusing on the math and physics
that apply to the problems I study, I have also put significant effort
into writing clean, safe, and efficient software.
%
We use git for version control and have a robust testing
framework for quality assurance, with more than a thousand tests.
%
I have been operating in a research-heavy role remotely for
several years, which is another exciting aspect of this position.
%

My background is focused on finite element methods and numerical analysis.
%
I have applied finite volume methods to fluid flow problems and have
studied meshfree methods during my time in Professor
Armando Duarte's research group.
%
My research background has also helped me develop the skills to learn
and implement cutting edge numerical methods from textbooks and
the literature.
%
Fluid structure interaction is a major concern in high-speed
aircraft applications, which motivated my research at the University
of Illinois.
%
This was a subject I encountered in detail in conversations with the
Air Force Research Lab while at the University of Illinois, and during
the two summers I spent at Boeing in the high-speed structures group.
%
While the finished product of my work is compiled into several journal
papers and conference presentations, my favorite part is pen-on-paper math
and commits sent to our git repository.
%

% talk about Altair here
% Use of MDS and hypermesh
% great reputation and innovative ideas
% benefits of Radioss
Altair has an exceptional reputation in the engineering software
space.
%
I have used several Altair tools during my research at the University
of Illinois and Boeing, and read extensively about the
innovative software in Altair's platform.
%
The Radioss solver is an industry-leading tool with a wide range of
exciting applications.
%
I have the skills and knowledge to contribute to the fluid structure
interaction capabilities of Radioss.
%
Applying my computational mechanics skills to such a high-performing tool
is an exciting opportunity.
%

My passion and skill set align with Altair's mission to develop
the best and most capable engineering and physics software.
%
My experience and proven ability to perform computational research
and implement cutting-edge methods in fluid structure interaction
problems make this a position I would excel in.
%
I would appreciate the opportunity to explore this opening further with you.
%


Sincerely,

Bryce Mazurowski
