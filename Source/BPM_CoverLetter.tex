Dear ATA Engineering Hiring Team,

I was excited to see the engineering openings for at ATA Engineering
while browsing the company website.
%
I recently had a meeting discussing the type of work, company
structure, and career opportuities at ATA with Eric Blades.
%
I have been fully focused on the research and development of
computational methods to solve engineering problems as I worked towards
completing my MS and PhD at the University of Illinois.
%
Focusing on fracture in anisotropic materials and multiscale modeling
of damage in composite materials, I think I would be a great fit for
the Composite Materials Analysis Engineer.
%

I have greatly enjoyed my time learning and creating at the University
of Illinois.
%
The work has been an engaging mix of reading papers, thinking through
problems, writing out the math, planning out algorithms, and
implementing them.
%
I have spent plenty of time focusing on the math and physics that
apply to these engineering problems, while also dedicating
considerable effort to developing clean, safe, and efficient software
to solve problems.
%
I am looking to take a next step in my career that is at the cutting
edge, but more applied to real engineering problems.
%

% How do my skills fit the role
Since starting my Masters research at the University of Illinois, I
have been working on projects motivated by high speed aircraft.
%
I have applied considerable focus to anisotropic and composite
material behavior, particularly on woven ceramic matrix
composites.
%
I have done detailed structural analysis in commercial
softwares on a wide range of problems.
%
A main part of my PhD research was testing available damage models to
capture CMC behavior.
%
This led to the implementation of a damage model from the
literature as an Abaqus UMAT.
%
I have also spent considerable time doing research in fracture
mechanics of anisotropic materials.
%
Fracture mechanics is where I started my research journey and an area
I love working in.
%
Whether one is analyzing a metal or composite structure, fracture is an
important phenmenon to capture.
%
My research work at the Universtity of Illinois and at Boeing
Research \& Technology has allowed me to develop a skillset and
know-how that would be a great fit at ATA Engineering.
%

% What is ATA doing that I like
% I have seen ATA presentations 
After chatting with Eric Blades, I have gotten a good feel for the
work ATA Engineering does.
%
The types of challenges that ATA is solving sound exciting.
%
I have also interfaced with a numnber of ATA Engineers at conferences
and meetings for the AFRL research center I was a part of while at the
University of Illinois.
%
The level of knowledge and detail always struck me as impressive.
%
I also always enjoyed how applied to work was, solving cutting-edge
problems using practical analysis methods and coming up with useful
answers.
%

% Strong closer
My passion and skill set align with ATA Engineering's mission to solve
the toughest analysis problems in aerospace and defense using
cutting-edge analysis and design.
%
My experience and proven ability to perform computational engineering research
make this a position I would excel in.
%
I would appreciate the opportunity to explore this opening further with you.
%


Sincerely,

Bryce Mazurowski
